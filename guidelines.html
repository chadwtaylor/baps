			<h1>BAPS Guidelines</h1>

			<div class="draftmode">
				THIS IS IN DRAFT MODE - TO BE FINALIZED AFTER AUGUST'S PRELIMINARY TOURNAMENT
			</div>

			<p>
				Any changes to these guidelines will be determined and approved by the majority of the poker players that attended past series at the first meeting (no quorum required) of every season during the month of August.
			</p>

			<p>
				The name of the informal poker organization and tournament shall be Deaf Bay Area Poker Series or BAPS.
			</p>
			<p>
				BAPS is organized exclusively for the Deaf poker community and is open to any player that would like to participate.
			</p>
			<p>
				There shall not be any membership fees to be part of the series.
			</p>
			<p>
				The series will be limited to 40 players per tournament (this is dependent on host discretion)
			</p>
			<p>
				There shall be a BAPS committee of 5 or more individuals to carry out these duties:
				<br/>
				* Event Communications (email, facebook, evite, etc)
				<br/>
				* Tournament Host and Set-up
				<br/>
				* Tournament Director (Operations and Prizes)
				<br/>
				* National Deaf Poker Tour Liaison

				Tournament dates will be for the first Saturday on certain months starting at 6:00pm (early registrants will receive $500 add-on): 
				<br/>
				* September, November, January, March, May, and June (free roll tournament)
				<br/>
				* September, October, January, February, May, and June (free roll tournament)
				<br/>
				* No late arrivals will be allowed unless the player prepaid for his seat (chips will be taken off the table after the third level)
			</p>

			<p>
				There will be Free-Roll tournaments to extinguish 80% of the remaining cash purse after all prizes are given away.  
				<br/>
				* Players will need to attend at least 3 tournaments to qualify for a free roll tournament
				<br/>
				* 80% of the remaining cash purse will be given away at the free roll tournament
				<br/>
				* Add-ons will be considered by the participants at the free roll event
				<br/>
				* 20% of the cash purse will be saved towards the next series (supplies, special prizes, etc.)
			</p>

			<p>
				BAPS will provide tables and cards.  Chips are to be provided by the host until we are able to purchase our own set.
			</p>

			<p>
				There is a $40 BAPS ($30 waived for host) buy-in at every tournament:
				<br>
				* $30 goes to the prize purse of the night (including high hand of the night)
				<br>
				* $9 goes to the ‘year-end prizes’
				<br>
				* $1 goes to the Royal Flush Pot (it automatically resets when someone wins a Royal Flush)
				<br>
				* Additional funding will go to the etcetera prizes
				<br>
				* Rabbit Chips will be available for $1.00 each (.50 will go to a charity – to be decided by the player of the year)
			</p>

			<p>
				BAPS will follow the FTP point system (see points distribution spreadsheet)
				<br>
				* All players will collect points
				<br>
				* Only players at the final table will collect points
			</p>

			<p>
				BAPS official year-end prizes:
				<br>
				* $9 per player will be withheld for the following prizes:

				$600-1200 -	$8000-16000 
				<br>
				$800-1600 - $16000-32000
			</p>
